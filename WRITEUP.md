### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
The most appropriate choice would be the app service since the application is lightweight and does not need a lot of computing power so a vm would be a waste of resources most of the time. Also depending on the demand the app services are auto-scaled and highly available which enhances the effiency of the application. as for the workflow it is easier for the developer to focus on the application with the abstraction of the infrastructe since most likely the website can be maintained by a small team effectivly.
### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
